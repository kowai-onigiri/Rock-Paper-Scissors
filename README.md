# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a project completed through The Odin Project curriculum. 

It is a simple rock, paper, scissors game with a simple, but decent and calming user interface. I hope to improve on the interface over time, making it more sleek
and perhaps adding animations or a story to go along with it.

The project took me between 6 and 7 hours all together. Three of those hours were spent building the HTML, CSS, and first try at the JavaScript. The remainder of the
time was spent on redoing the JavaScript from scratch since my first attempt lacked the infrustructure to properly make use of the DOM and nest functions for the 
best result.

Through this project, I gained a better understanding of DOM in JS as well as how to use DOM, functions, and event listeners to produce functionality on a webpage.
